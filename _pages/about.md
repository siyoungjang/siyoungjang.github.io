Hi There! :wave: 

I am currently working as a research scientist at <a href='https://www.bell-labs.com/'>Nokia Bell Labs </a> in Cambridge, United Kingdom. 
Our team mainly focuses in multi-device systems to support collaborative and interactive services. 
Today, on/near-body devices are packed with intelligent sensing technologies and we can find ourselves surrounded by these technologies.
We explore systematic challenges and issues in supporting multi-modal AI/ML services seamlessly across multiple devices of different class for edge intelligence.

My research interest lies in networking technologies, internet of things (IoT), mobile computing, edge AI, embedded ML, tinyML and edge video analtyic system. I enjoy building real world, end-to-end systems and applications. I also enjoy working and collaborating with experts from various domains. 

Feel free to contact me. ;)
